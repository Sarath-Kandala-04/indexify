# Changelog

All notable changes to Indexify are documented here. Versions follow the roadmap: one isolated feature per version.

## [1.1.0] - Keyboard Shortcuts

### Added
- `Ctrl+N` — switch to Notes and instantly create a new note, focused and ready to title.
- `Ctrl+T` — switch to To-dos and focus the add-task input.
- `Ctrl+E` — switch to Expenses and focus the amount input.
- Centralized keyboard handler in `App.jsx` (single listener, shortcut map), guarded against firing while typing in any input/textarea/select/contenteditable.

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Notes, To-dos, Expenses, and Subscriptions panels.
- Local storage persistence per module.
- Dark/light theme toggle.
